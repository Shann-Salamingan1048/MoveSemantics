/*
	When it comes to initialization, Pass by value + move is best
	When it comes to modifying existing members, Pass by value const& is best
	When it comes cheap move operations such as vectors, strings, pass by value + move is best
	When it comes expensive move operations such as std::arrays, Large structs, or types with many small allocations, Overload Constructors are the best

	Cheap Moves  (O(1)):
		The type uses pointer indirection (e.g., dynamic allocations).
		Moving only swaps pointers, avoiding deep copies.
			Examples:
				std::string (typically stores data on the heap).
				std::vector, std::list, std::unordered_map (own heap-allocated data).
				std::unique_ptr (just a pointer swap).

	Expensive Moves (O(N)):
		The type stores data contiguously in itself (no indirection).
		Moving requires copying/moving each element individually.
			Examples:
				std::array<T, N> (fixed-size stack allocation, moves each T).
				Plain structs with many members (struct BigData { int[1000]; };).
				std::tuple or std::pair with non-movable types.


	Small objects (e.g., int, double) are cheap to copy/move.
	Large objects (e.g., std::array<int, 1000000>) are costly.

	Compare copy vs. move performance:
	BenchMark:
		auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
		auto moved_obj = std::move(obj);  // Test move
		auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
		std::cout << "Move took: " << (end - start).count() << " ns\n";
	If move ≈ copy time → Expensive.
	If move ≪ copy time → Cheap.
